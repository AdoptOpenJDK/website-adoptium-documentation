== Sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
To contribute to this project the https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA)] must be signed.
This page will walk you through this process.

=== Create Eclipse Account
First, we need to create an Eclipse Foundation account.

1. Go to the https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/register[Eclipse Registration page]
2. Fill all Required fields and submit
** Eclipse expects you to use the entered E-Mail address for every contribution, e.q. user.email for git
3. Activate your account via the activation link in your mailbox
** Sender should be *webmaster@eclipse.org* with the subject *Eclipse Account Registration*

We are one step further from becoming an Eclipse Contributor, we just need to sign the ECA.

=== Sign the ECA
Signing the ECA is straightforward and is done online.

1. Navigate to the https://accounts.eclipse.org/user/login[login page] of Eclipse Accounts page
2. Login with your E-Mail address and password
3. Eclipse Accounts navigates you directly to the sign page
** Read the https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php[ECA]
** Enter the requested information
** Submit via *Accept* button

Now the Status panel in the upper right corner should show that you signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement.
It should look like this:

=== ECA Sign check failed, but why?
For every pull request, a GitHub Action verifies that the author signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement.
This can fail if:

* You have not Eclipse Account
* You have not signed the Eclipse Contributor Agreement
* You have configured git to use a different E-Mail address than you used to sign the ECA
** `user.email` setting for git must equal to that used for your Eclipse Foundation account

If non of the above is the case, feel free to reach out to the maintainers.
